## Who

My name is Adam Chevalier and I do software development, primarily in test. What does that mean? In short, I write software that tests software. I've been doing it since 2012, mostly working with C# and Selenium with forays into Node, JavaScript, Python, Docker, etc. In that time I've learned some things that other people might find helpful. At least they're things I wish I'd known sooner.

I'm from Wisconsin but live in Minnesota (that's in the Midwest of the United States for those of you not in the know). My two biggest hobbies are Tabletop RPGs (Pathfinder mostly) and game modding, the biggest of which is [Ancient Religions Reborn](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/ancient-religions-reborn.829413/) (on [github](https://github.com/xirsoi/ancientreligions)).

## What

I'll mostly be posting about testing software, both in general and from an automation perspective. I'll also sometimes talk about general software development, tech, and my hobbies.

### Open Source

I'm the official maintaner of the Testrail Plugin for Jenkins, which has been a lesson in humility and struggle. I'll definitely write some stuff regarding my experiences there.

I've also made minor contributions to the xunit project and would like to do more, so I'll try to do write-ups whenever I dive into something new.

## Where

Here!

## When

Whenever I find time, inspiration, and/or need, I guess.

## Why

To [conserve my keystrokes](https://youtu.be/FS1mnISoG7U?t=860). I was writing training documentation and realized it would work just fine as a blog post. Coworkers keep telling me I'm pretty good at my job, so I thought maybe I have something to say that's worth hearing. I guess we'll find out. Besides, if I can help out some poor soul who was struggling mightily like I was, it's all worth it :)

## Shining Source? What's that about?

It's a reference to my last name. Chevalier is French for knight. As in "knight in shining armor", but I'm a developer in shining source.

I don't know, I like the way it sounds ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
