Hi, I'm Adam, thanks for checking out this site!

I'm kind of hoping to use this as a place to talk about the things I've worked on and hopefully help other people that may be struggling with the same issues I've run into.
Also it might boost the signal of projects or people I think deserve one. Besides isn't everyone supposed to have a software blog to point at and impress hiring managers these days?

No pressure.

So, check out the [about](/about) page to learn a little more about me and what I'm doing here, or checkout the [archive](/archives) for older posts. The most recent 5 posts will always be on the first page.
